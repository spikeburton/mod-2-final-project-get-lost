# Get Lost
## Pitch
* Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the crowded city traffic, glaring lights, and overwhelming sounds?
* Do you ever wish for quiet, open spaces lending you the chance to forget your daily stresses, and just _drive away_ your worries?
* Thatâ€™s why we created *Get Lost*. Itâ€™s an opportunity to take off for a Sunday drive with little forethought. Spontaneity deserves to be rewarded with bliss!
* Come and take an adventure with us and *Get Lost*!
## Project Setup
Run `rails new mod-2-final-project-get-lost -T -B` to generate the project skeleton. Edit the `Gemfile` to setup the correct version of the `sqlite3` gem. Also add `pry-rails`,`rspec-rails` and `capybara` to the development/test group. Uncomment the line for the `bcrypt` gem. Run `bundle` to install all the dependencies. Run `rails console` to check everything is working. Run `rails generate rspec:install` to generate spec file structure. Add `require 'capybara/rspec'` to `rails_helper.rb` to setup Capybara. Run `git` with an initial commit.
